/*
 * Current Problems with the Seven Physics Engine
 * -Going foward when not colliding with a Collidable Object
 * -Cannot jump if there is a collidable object above the player
 *          *doesn't seem to take into account the x value of the player and object
 * -Animation bug, keep walking while running into wall, but if user lets go of 'D' 
 *                  then animation will stop looping if they press D again
 * -Comments :), I was just a little confused if rightCollision and aboveCollision are in perspective
 *               to the player or the object colliding with the player
 * 
 * I know all of these are pretty easy fixes just thought listing them would help us work through it
 * 
 * Also, GRATZ MAKING IT THROUGH WORK!!!!
